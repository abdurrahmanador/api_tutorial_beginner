# RESTAPI_FOR_BEGINNER
Welcome to RESTAPI_FOR_BEGINNER, a beginner-friendly project designed to help you master RESTful API integration in Flutter effortlessly. This project leverages modern tools and patterns, empowering you to grasp the essentials of API integration with ease.

# Features:
GetX Integration: Experience the power of GetX for seamless state management and navigation.
Demo Endpoint: Utilize a demo endpoint to practice fetching data from a remote server.
MVVM Architecture: Embrace the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern for clean and organized code.
HTTP Requests: Learn to perform HTTP requests, facilitating seamless interaction with the API.

# In Model:
Discover all the data files here.
I've organized the data classes separately for clarity and simplicity. 
Although they could all be housed in a single file like home_data.dart, keeping them separate helps maintain clarity. In home_data.dart, I've connected all the data files, providing a centralized location for accessing them.

I've included only three data files here for demonstration purposes, but they should suffice to understand the structure and organization of the project.

# In View:
Passing arguments from ListTile (in home_screen.dart) to user_detail_screen enhances the user experience by providing detailed insights.

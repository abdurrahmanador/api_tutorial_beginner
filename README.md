# In model directory:
Discover all the data files here.
I've organized the data classes separately for clarity and simplicity. <br>
Although they could all be housed in a single file like home_data.dart, keeping them separate helps maintain clarity.<br> In home_data.dart, I've connected all the data files, providing a centralized location for accessing them.

I've included only three data files here for demonstration purposes, <br>but they should suffice to understand the structure and organization of the project.

# In view directory:
Passing arguments from ListTile (in home_screen.dart) to user_detail_screen enhances the user experience by providing detailed insights.
